# 3.1.0 - JS Topic: Callbacks

---

## Synchronous vs. Asynchronous

---

_Synchronous_: Things happens one at a time.

---

_Asynchronous_: Multiple things happen at the same time.

---

### Example

An app that fetches 2 resources from the network, and then combines the results into a final (needed) result.

---

<img src='./assets/async_sync.png' style='width: 100%;' />

---

### Important Distinction

In a _synchronous_ model, waiting for actions to finish is **implicit**, but in an _asynchronous_ model, it is **explicit**.

---

Synchronous === implicit control

Asynchronous === explicit control

---

Both of the important JavaScript programming platforms
—browsers and Node.js—
make operations that might take a while **asynchronous**.

_Examples of operations that might take time?_

---

## Callbacks

What is a callback?

---

- A callback is a function that is to be executed, or _called_ after another function has finished executing.

- Any functions that is passed as an argument to another function is a callback function.

---

```js
console.log('do first thing');
console.log('do second thing');
console.log('do third thing');

// expected output

first
second
third
```

_What is expected here?_

---

What happens if the second thing takes longer than expected?

---

```js
console.log('do first thing');
setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('do second thing');
}, 2000);
console.log('do third thing');
```
first
third
second
---

### Important

JavaScript _did_ execute the functions in the right order,
but it **didn't wait for an answer (response)** before moving on to the next function to execute. 

---

## Example

```js
function writeStory(topic) {
    alert(`Begin writing a story about ${topic}`);
}

writeStory('traveling to Mars');
```

---

```js
function writeStory(topic, callback) {
    alert(`Begin writing a story about ${topic}`);
    callback();
}

writeStory('traveling to Mars', function() {
    alert('Done! Time to submit it.');
});
```

---

Have we used callbacks in any of our code to date?

_Examples?_

---

## Callback Hell... or the Pyramid of Doom.

Let's say we have a function that will notify the world of a message after an action is complete.

```js
function tellWorld(message, callback) {
    console.log(message);
    callback();
};
```

---

Sooo.... Is a callback _synchronous_ or _asynchronous_?

---

Well that depends...

- `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, requests, and events are asynchronous.
- most other callbacks are synchronous.
